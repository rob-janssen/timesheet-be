# Timesheet backend

Backend API build in Express for creating/deleting/changing (CRUD) timesheets.

At this moment I am building my timesheets in Excel and sent them to my customers manually. 
I would like to have the data stored in a MongoDB database and being able to sent the timesheet(s) in PDF format via mail.

Work in progress :).
